# Valid Palindrome

### Problem Statement

A phrase is a **palindrome** if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string `s`, return `true` _if it is a **palindrome**, or `false` otherwise._

#### Example 1:

```
Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: s = "race a car"
Output: false
Explanation: "raceacar" is not a palindrome.
```

#### Example 3:

```
Input: s = " "
Output: true
Explanation: s is an empty string "" after removing non-alphanumeric characters.
Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.
```

#### Constraints:

- `1` `<=` `s.length` `<=` `2` \* 10<sup>5</sup>
- `s` consists only of printable ASCII characters.

### Code

```python title="Python Code"
import re
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        # clean up the string first
        s = re.sub("[^a-z0-9]", "", s.lower())
		# is it the same as its reverse?
        return s == s[::-1]
```
