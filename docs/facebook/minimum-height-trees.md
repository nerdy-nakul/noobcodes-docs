# Minimum Height Trees

### Problem Statement

A tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path. In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree.

Given a tree of `n` nodes labelled from `0` to `n - 1`, and an array of `n - 1` `edges` where `edges[i]` `=` [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>] indicates that there is an undirected edge between the two nodes a<sub>i</sub> and b<sub>i</sub> in the tree, you can choose any node of the tree as the root. When you select a node `x` as the root, the result tree has height `h`. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height (i.e. `min(h)`) are called **minimum height trees** (MHTs).

Return _a list of all **MHTs'** root labels_. You can return the answer in **any order**.

The **height** of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf.

[Leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-height-trees)

#### Example 1:

![ex1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/01/e1.jpg)

```
Input: n = 4, edges = [[1,0],[1,2],[1,3]]
Output: [1]
Explanation: As shown, the height of the tree is 1 when the root is the node with label 1 which is the only MHT.
```

#### Example 2:

![ex1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/01/e2.jpg)

```
Input: n = 6, edges = [[3,0],[3,1],[3,2],[3,4],[5,4]]
Output: [3,4]
```

#### Constraints:

- `1` `<=` `n` `<=` 2 \* 10<sup>4</sup>
- `edges.length == n - 1`
- `0` `<=` a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub> `<` `n`
- a<sub>i</sub> != b<sub>i</sub>
- All the pairs (a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>) are distinct.
- The given input is **guaranteed** to be a tree and there will be **no repeated** edges.

```python title="Python Code"

class Solution(object):
        def findMinHeightTrees(self, n, edges):

        def makeGraph(E):
            graph = collections.defaultdict(set)
            for e in E:
                graph[e[0]].add(e[1])
                graph[e[1]].add(e[0])
            return graph

        def BFS(start, G):
            parents, visited = {}, set()
            queue = collections.deque([(start, 0, None)])
            V, farthest = None, 0
            while queue:
                v, dist, p = queue.popleft()
                if dist > farthest: farthest, V = dist, v
                visited.add(v)
                parents[v] = p
                for vtx in G[v]:
                    if vtx not in visited: queue.append((vtx, dist+1, v))
            return V, farthest, parents

        if not edges: return [0] if n == 1 else []
        G = makeGraph(edges)
        end, farthest, parents = BFS(BFS(0, G)[0], G)
        vCount = farthest + 1
        target, root, prev = vCount // 2, None, None
        while target > -1:
            root, prev = end, root
            end = parents[end]
            target -= 1
        return [root] if vCount % 2 != 0 else [root, prev]
