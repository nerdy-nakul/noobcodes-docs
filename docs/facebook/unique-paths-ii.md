# Unique Paths II

### Problem Statement

You are given an m x n integer array grid. There is a robot initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., `grid[0][0]`). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., `grid[m - 1][n - 1]`). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

An obstacle and space are marked as 1 or 0 respectively in grid. A path that the robot takes cannot include any square that is an obstacle.

Return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.

The testcases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 \* 10<sup>9</sup>.

[Leetcode Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths-ii)

#### Example 1:

```
Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,1],[0,0]]
Output: 1
```

#### Constraints:

- `m == obstacleGrid.length`
- `n == obstacleGrid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 100`
- `obstacleGrid[i][j] is 0 or 1`

### Code

```python title="Python Code"
class Solution:
    def uniquePathsWithObstacles(self, obstacleGrid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        m,n=len(obstacleGrid),len(obstacleGrid[0])
        def countPath(i,j):
            if i>=m or j>=n or obstacleGrid[i][j]==1 :
                return 0
            if i==m-1 and j==n-1:
                if obstacleGrid[i][j]==1:
                    return 0
                return 1
            return countPath(i+1,j) + countPath(i,j+1)
        return countPath(0,0)
```
