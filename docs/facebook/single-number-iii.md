# Single Number III

### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once. You can return the answer in **any order**.

You must write an algorithm that runs in linear runtime complexity and uses only constant extra space.

[Leetcode Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-iii)

#### Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,2,5]
Output: [3,5]
Explanation:  [5, 3] is also a valid answer.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [-1,0]
Output: [-1,0]
```

#### Example 3:

```
Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: [1,0]
```

#### Constraints:

- `2` `<=` `nums.length` `<=` `3` \* `10`<sup>4</sup>
- `-2`<sup>31</sup> `<=` `nums[i]` `<=` `2`<sup>31</sup> `-1`
- Each integer in `nums` will **appear twice**, only two integers will **appear once**.

### Code

```python title="Python"
class Solution:
   def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
       ans = []
       for i, n1 in enumerate(nums):
           for j, n2 in enumerate(nums):
               if i != j and n1 == n2: break
               elif j == len(nums)-1:
                   ans.append(n1)
       return ans

```
