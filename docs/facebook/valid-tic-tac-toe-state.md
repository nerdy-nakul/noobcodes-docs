# Valid Tic-Tac-Toe State

### Problem Statement

Given a Tic-Tac-Toe board as a string array board, return true if and only if it is possible to reach this board position during the course of a valid tic-tac-toe game.

The board is a 3 x 3 array that consists of characters ' ', 'X', and 'O'. The ' ' character represents an empty square.

Here are the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe:

- Players take turns placing characters into empty squares ' '.
- The first player always places 'X' characters, while the second player always places 'O' characters.
- 'X' and 'O' characters are always placed into empty squares, never filled ones.
- The game ends when there are three of the same (non-empty) character filling any row, column, or diagonal.
- The game also ends if all squares are non-empty.
- No more moves can be played if the game is over.

### Examples:

```
Example 1:

Input: board = ["O  ","   ","   "]
Output: false
Explanation: The first player always plays "X".

Example 2:

Input: board = ["XOX"," X ","   "]
Output: false
Explanation: Players take turns making moves.

Example 3:

Input: board = ["XOX","O O","XOX"]
Output: true
```

#### Constraints:

- board.length == 3
- board[i].length == 3
- board[i][j] is either 'X', 'O', or ' '.
