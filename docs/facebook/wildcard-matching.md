# Wildcard Matching

### Problem Statement

Given an input string (`s`) and a pattern (`p`), implement wildcard pattern matching with support for `'?'` and `'*'` where:

- `'?'` Matches any single character.
- `'*'` Matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence).

The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

[Leetcode Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/wildcard-matching)

#### Example 1:

```
Input: s = "aa", p = "a"
Output: false

Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: s = "aa", p = "*"
Output: true

Explanation: '*' matches any sequence.
```

#### Example 3:

```
Input: s = "cb", p = "?a"
Output: false

Explanation: '?' matches 'c', but the second letter is 'a', which does not match 'b'.
```

#### Constraints:

- `0 <= s.length, p.length <= 2000`
- `s` contains only lowercase English letters.
- `p` contains only lowercase English letters, `'?'` or `'*'`.

            # a '*' in the pattern previously

                # Move the pointer for the input string to the next character
                # after the last character matched
                i = last_match + 1
                # Move the pointer for the last character matched forward
                last_match += 1
            # If none of the above conditions are met, the input string and the
            # pattern do not match

                return False

        # Loop through the remaining characters in the pattern and check if they
        # are all '*' characters
        while j < len(p) and p[j] == '*':

        # Return True if all the characters in the pattern have been processed,
        # False otherwise
