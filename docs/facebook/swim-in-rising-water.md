# Swim in Rising Water

### Problem Statement

You are given an `n x n` integer matrix `grid` where each value `grid[i][j]` represents the elevation at that point `(i, j)`.

The rain starts to fall. At time `t`, the depth of the water everywhere is `t`. You can swim from a square to another 4-directionally adjacent square if and only if the elevation of both squares individually are at most `t`. You can swim infinite distances in zero time. Of course, you must stay within the boundaries of the grid during your swim.

Return _the least time until you can reach the bottom right square `(n - 1, n - 1)` if you start at the top left square_ `(0, 0)`.

#### Example 1:

![ex1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/29/swim1-grid.jpg)

```
Input: grid = [[0,2],[1,3]]
Output: 3
Explanation:
At time 0, you are in grid location (0, 0).
You cannot go anywhere else because 4-directionally adjacent neighbors have a higher elevation than t = 0.
You cannot reach point (1, 1) until time 3.
When the depth of water is 3, we can swim anywhere inside the grid.
```

#### Example 2:

![ex2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/29/swim2-grid-1.jpg)

```
Input: grid = [[0,1,2,3,4],[24,23,22,21,5],[12,13,14,15,16],[11,17,18,19,20],[10,9,8,7,6]]
Output: 16
Explanation: The final route is shown.
We need to wait until time 16 so that (0, 0) and (4, 4) are connected.
```

#### Constraints:

- `n == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= n <= 50`
- `0` `<=` `grid[i][j]` `<` `n`<sup>2</sup>
- Each value `grid[i][j]` is **unique**.

### Code

```python title="Python Code"

class Solution:
        def swimInWater(self, grid):
        N, pq, seen, res = len(grid), [(grid[0][0], 0, 0)], set([(0, 0)]), 0
        while True:
            T, x, y = heapq.heappop(pq)
            res = max(res, T)
            if x == y == N - 1:
                return res
            for i, j in [(x + 1, y), (x, y + 1), (x - 1, y), (x, y - 1)]:
                if 0 <= i < N and 0 <= j < N and (i, j) not in seen:
                    seen.add((i, j))
                    heapq.heappush(pq, (grid[i][j], i, j))
```
