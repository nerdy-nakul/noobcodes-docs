# Course Schedule

### Problem Statement

There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array prerequisites where `prerequisites[i] = [a`<sub>i</sub>`, b`<sub>i</sub>`]` indicates that you must take course `b`<sub>i</sub> first if you want to take course `a`<sub>i</sub>.

- For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.

Return `true` if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return `false`.

[Leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule)

#### Example 1:

```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true

Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take.
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false

Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take.
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
```

#### Constraints:

- `1 <= numCourses <= 2000`
- `0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000`
- `prerequisites[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= a`<sub>i</sub>, `b`<sub>i</sub> `< numCourses`
- All the pairs `prerequisites[i]` are **unique**.
