# Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

### Problem Statement

Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
[LeetCode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/description/)

Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

#### Example 1:

```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3

Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1

Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

#### Example 3:

```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3

Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

#### Constraints:

- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10`<sup>4</sup>
- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

### Code

```python title="Python Code"
class Solution:
    # @return an integer
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s):
        start = maxLength = 0
        usedChar = {}

        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] in usedChar and start <= usedChar[s[i]]:
                start = usedChar[s[i]] + 1
            else:
                maxLength = max(maxLength, i - start + 1)

            usedChar[s[i]] = i

        return maxLength


```

```cpp title="C++"
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
        vector<int> dict(256, -1);
        int maxLen = 0, start = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i != s.length(); i++) {
            if (dict[s[i]] > start)
                start = dict[s[i]];
            dict[s[i]] = i;
            maxLen = max(maxLen, i - start);
        }
        return maxLen;
    }
};


```
