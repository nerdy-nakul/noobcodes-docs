# Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List

### Problem Statement

You are given a doubly linked list, which contains nodes that have a next pointer, a previous pointer, and an additional child pointer. This child pointer may or may not point to a separate doubly linked list, also containing these special nodes. These child lists may have one or more children of their own, and so on, to produce a multilevel data structure as shown in the example below.

Given the head of the first level of the list, flatten the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly linked list. Let `curr` be a node with a child list. The nodes in the child list should appear after `curr` and before `curr.next` in the flattened list.

Return the head of the flattened list. The nodes in the list must have all of their child pointers set to `null`.

#### Example 1:

![Question - 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/14/flaten.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,2,5,3,4,null,6]
Output: [1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

#### Example 3:

```
Input: root = [0]
Output: [0]
```

#### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 2000]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

### Code

```python title="Python Code"

class Solution(object):
    def flatten_recur(self, root, prev):
    if root is None:
        return None

    prev_r = self.flatten_recur(root.right, prev)
    if prev_r:
        prev_l = self.flatten_recur(root.left, prev_r)
    else:
        prev_l = self.flatten_recur(root.left, prev)


    if prev_l:
        root.right = prev_l
    elif prev_r:
        root.right = prev_r
    else:
        root.right = prev

    root.left = None

    return root

```
