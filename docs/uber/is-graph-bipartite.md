# Is Graph Bipartite?

### Problem Statement

There is an undirected graph with n nodes, where each node is numbered between 0 and n - 1. You are given a 2D array graph, where graph[u] is an array of nodes that node u is adjacent to. More formally, for each v in graph[u], there is an undirected edge between node u and node v. The graph has the following properties:

- There are no self-edges (graph[u] does not contain u).
- There are no parallel edges (graph[u] does not contain duplicate values).
- If v is in graph[u], then u is in graph[v] (the graph is undirected).
- The graph may not be connected, meaning there may be two nodes u and v such that there is no path between them.

A graph is bipartite if the nodes can be partitioned into two independent sets A and B such that every edge in the graph connects a node in set A and a node in set B.

Return true if and only if it is bipartite.

[Leetcode Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-graph-bipartite/)

#### Example 1:

```
Input: graph = [[1,2,3],[0,2],[0,1,3],[0,2]]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no way to partition the nodes into two independent sets such that every edge connects a node in one and a node in the other.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: graph = [[1,3],[0,2],[1,3],[0,2]]
Output: true
Explanation: We can partition the nodes into two sets: {0, 2} and {1, 3}.
```

#### Constraints:

- graph.length == n
- 1 <= n <= 100
- 0 <= graph[u].length < n
- 0 <= graph[u][i] <= n - 1
- graph[u] does not contain u.
- All the values of graph[u] are unique.
- If graph[u] contains v, then graph[v] contains u.

### Code

```python title="Python Code"

class Solution(object):
    def isBipartite(self, graph):
        color = defaultdict(lambda: -1)
        return all(self.dfs(graph, v, edges, 0, color) for v, edges in enumerate(graph) if color[v] == -1)

    def dfs(self, graph, v, edges, cur_color, color):
        if color[v] != -1: return color[v] == cur_color
        color[v] = cur_color
        return all(self.dfs(graph, e, graph[e], int(not cur_color), color) for e in edges)
```
