# Max Area of Island

### Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `grid`. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected **4-directionally** (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The **area** of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

Return the maximum **area** of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.

#### Example 1:

![alt text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/01/maxarea1-grid.jpg)

```
Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 6
Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.
```

#### Example 2:

```
Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 0
```

#### Constraints:

- m == grid.length
- n == grid[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 50
- grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
